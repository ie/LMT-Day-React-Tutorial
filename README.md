# Getting Started with Create React App


## Welcome to debugging React meeting!

We have something for you! Alexandr and Sara have prepared a simple yet

### `To run the project: npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `1.Fix the route to Contact page:`
There is a simple Contact us page, which is there but you can't access it via the navbar. You need to check on what's wrong it's route.


### `2.Again Contact page! Some features are not working here:`
When you type in the Subject, Email and Request field, nothing happens. You need to check the event listeners. 
Also the submit button is not doing anything, complete what you need to write so that you are able to submit the form and show an Alert that confirms user has submitted successfully. 

### `Feel free to add more pages to our shop if you got extra time! Also you can add an API instead of using the json for  products.`
